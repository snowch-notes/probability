**Russell’s Paradox Overview:**

Russell’s Paradox questions whether a "set of all sets that do not contain themselves" can exist. If it exists, it contradicts itself, leading to an unavoidable paradox.

**Example Representation:**

Universe of Sets (U): This represents the entire universe of all possible sets.

Set R: This represents the set of all sets that do not contain themselves.

Example Sets:

Set A: A simple set containing the elements {1, 2, 3}.  
Set B: A set containing Set A and the elements {4, 5}.  
Set C: A set containing Set B and the elements {6, 7}.

```
Universe of Sets (U)  
  |  
  \+-- Set R (**contains sets that don't contain themselves**)  
        |  
        \+-- Set A (contains {1, 2, 3})  
        |  
        \+-- Set B (contains {A, 4, 5})  
        |  
        \+-- Set C (contains {B, 6, 7})
```

The Paradox Explained:

**Case 1: R ∈ R (R contains itself)**

If R is an element of itself, then by definition, R must not contain itself. But if it does contain itself, it contradicts its own definition of only containing sets that don’t contain themselves.

This situation results in a contradiction because R can’t simultaneously contain itself and not contain itself.

**Case 2: R ∉ R (R does not contain itself)**

If R does not contain itself, then by its own definition, R should be in R (since R only contains sets that don’t contain themselves). However, this again leads to a contradiction, because now R must contain itself.

Again, this leads to a contradiction because R should contain itself according to its own definition.

**Conclusion:**

In both cases, R leads to a logical contradiction. The paradox shows that the idea of a set containing all sets that do not contain themselves is inherently contradictory and highlights the limitations of naive set theory. Russell’s Paradox played a key role in the development of more sophisticated set theories, like Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, which avoids such paradoxes by imposing restrictions on the formation of sets.
